    <p>This site is a work in progress. For now, here are some fun facts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, that's the Washington Monument in the picture. (I really love that scene in Forrest Gump.)</li>
      <li>The site logo is based on <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8F" target="_blank">the middle character</a> of my name.</li>
      <li>I "know" a few languages. In sequence of fluency: English, Chinese, Japanese, Tagalog, and Spanish.</li>
      <li>Why those languages? I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third culture kid</a>. I have also been living in a different continent from the rest of my family since I was 16.</li>
      <li>My favorite song of all time is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KR6sDycuU" target="_blank">"RTB" by Monsieur Kayamatsu</a>.</li>
      <li>This site doesn't have any tracking mechanisms! Rejoice!</li>
