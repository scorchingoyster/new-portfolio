      <h1>Hello, this is Hong.</h1>
      <p>I'm a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Informatics Program of Penn State University</a>, working with <a href="https://priyakumar.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Priya Kumar</a> in the Living Privacy Research Group.</p>
      <p>As a researcher, I am in the intersections of privacy, security, learning, and human-computer interaction &mdash; though I often find myself peeking into other disciplines as well. The world is just too fascinating.</p>
      <p>Need to get in touch? Feel free to email <strong>hongyi.dong [at] psu [dot] edu</strong>. <br> <small>(My questionable life advice is also available upon request.)</small></p>

    <p>This site is a work in progress. Here are some fun facts for now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, that's the Washington Monument in the picture. (I really love that scene in Forrest Gump.)</li>
      <li>The site logo is based on <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8F" target="_blank">the middle character</a> of my name.</li>
      <li>I "know" a few languages. In sequence of fluency: English, Chinese, Japanese, Tagalog, and Spanish.</li>
      <li>Why those languages? I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third culture kid</a>. I have also been living in a different continent from the rest of my family since I was 16.</li>
      <li>My favorite song of all time is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KR6sDycuU" target="_blank">"RTB" by Monsieur Kayamatsu</a>.</li>
      <li>This site doesn't have any tracking mechanisms! Rejoice!</li>
