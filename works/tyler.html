			<h1>Designing for an Audience in Security</h1>

			<p>In the summer of 2013, I interned with the application UX team at Tyler Technologies to research and design for a mobile app concept, Munis Delivery. Over the span of three months, I brought the concept from one sheet of high-level description to an interactive prototype featuring a complete user flow.</p>

				Iterating on the Company Website
			</h2>
			<p>Working with our Director of Engineering, I designed and developed the front-end portion of the company's website, moving it from the generic Bootstrap 3 template and into my custom layouts. This spanned across two major iterations and many minor feature additions over time.</p>
			<p>By introducing a new set of mobile-friendly layouts and information architecture, <em>I managed to improve the loading speed by four folds</em>.</p>

			<p>To help market the company's brand, I created a mascot that's used across various digital and print materials &mdash; whether it's a victorious pose on a t-shirt that's given out to attendees of our expert training, or a troubled look when website visitors stumbled upon a missing page.</p>
