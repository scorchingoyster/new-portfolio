			<h2>The Great Migration</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a source of growing pains in terms of content discovery and usability, and the situation only worsened as more and more users added .</p>

			<p>Thus came "The Great Migration" initiative.</p>

			<p>At the highest level, the inititiave aimed to address the following problems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tangled use cases that confuse users of academic vs archival contents</li>
				<li>Limited legacy software system that make adding new features challenging</li>
				<li>Dense information architecture that leads to disorganization of contents</li>
			</ul>
		<div class="text">

		<div class="text">

			<p>The answer was to migrate the academic contents to a new open source repository system and have it inherit the name of Carolina Digital Repository (CDR 2.0).</p>

			<p>Without having to devise workarounds, the renamed legacy system &mdash; Digital Collections Repository (DCR) &mdash; can be optimized and more easily maintained in the long run.</p>

					<li>All UX efforts had to fit within my time in grad school and backup plans have to be made for the future to cover for the lack of UX support</li>
					<li>Launch date of CDR 2.0 had to be before the 2019 spring graduation season to prepare for the influx of thesis papers and projects</li>
					<li>UNC is a public institution, so we were a small team with a huge backlog and limited resources</li>

				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				By the Communities, For the Communities
			</h2>

			<p>Some research had already been done before my arrival, so a major part of the work was to consolidate the findings and identify the areas that needed more work.</p>
		<div class="text">

		<div class="text">
			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes. To make sure that we understood the demographics better, I identified the various groups of users and created the following personas for both platforms.</p>
		</div>	

		<div class="text">
			<p>Lastly, going through a decade worth of web analytics archive revealed interesting navigation behavioral patterns that were previously unknown to the team.</p>
		</div>

		</div>
			<p>Key research takeaways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The existing process for searching, filtering, and viewing files in the repository was a major pain point, as the complex navigation and browsing tools only added to the confusion.</li>
				<li>Based on the link analaysis, the content consumption was not evenly distributed at all. For example: visual media saw a significantly higher use than the rest. The platform should seek to improve the experience of viewing those content.</li>
				<li>The mixing of academic and other contents was obviously problematic enough that even internal members couldnâ€™t differentiate them from time to time.</li>

				A Task-Oriented Usability Test of CDR 2.0

			<p>As a part of my own academic research, I conducted a formal usability test with the target users.  This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform, and the findings were then used to introduce specific workflow improvements to help better prepare for the public launch.</p>

				<span>DESIGN</span>
				A New Look to the Legacy Platform
			</h2>

			<p>For the DCR legacy platform, almost all of the design efforts went into addressing age-old issues that were overlooked throughout the years of ad-hoc development.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some of the effort went into developing a concept for more intuitive and streamlined access controls for the repository administrators.</p>
