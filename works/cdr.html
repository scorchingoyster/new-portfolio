			<h1>Carolina Digital Repository</h1>

			<p>While I was at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I helped The Repository Application Team to research, design, and develop the new digital repositories that served thousands of the university community members.

			<h2>
				<span>BACKGROUND</span>
				The Great Migration
			</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a major source of growing pains when it comes to content discovery and usability, and the situation only worsened as more contents were added into the repository.</p>

			<p>Thus came <strong>"The Great Migration"</strong> initiative.</p>

			<div class="graphics">
				<img src="{{ '/assets/img/cdr/split-chart.png' }}" alt="">
			</div>

			<p>The plan was to migrate the academic contents to a new open source system and let it inherit the Carolina Digital Repository name (CDR 2.0).</p>

			<p>The legacy system was renamed to Digital Collections Repository (DCR). Without having to devise workarounds, this would allow the old platform be optimized for easier maintenance in the long run.</p>

			<p>The goal of this initiative was to address the following high-level problems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tangled use cases that confuse users of academic vs archival contents</li>
				<li>Limited capabilities of the old system makes it hard to add new features</li>
				<li>Confusing information architecture that leads to disorganized contents</li>
			</ul>

				<span>LOGISTICS</span>
				A Two-Year Journey
			</h2>
			<p>Coming in right at the cusp of the migration kickoff planning, I filled in the much needed UX functions for the team and led all the necessary efforts for the overall initiative — whether's interviewing stakeholders, designing visual deliverables, or conducting usability tests.</p>
			<p>As I have done web development before, I also supported the developers in some front-end code and quality assurance work.</p>

				<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Repository Application Team</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Three fullstack developers &ndash; share development work across both platforms</li>
							<li>Two program managers &ndash; manages each platform respectively</li>
							<li>A metadata specialist &ndash; supports metadata auditing and content organization</li>
							<li>A UX specialist &ndash; myself</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Library Stakeholders</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Head of Library UX Department &ndash; provide UX guidance and feedback</li>
							<li>Various department heads as primary stakeholders</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="list">

				<h3>Constraints &amp; Challenges</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>All UX efforts had to fit within the two-year time span and backup plans have to be made for the future to cover for the lack of dedicated UX function.</li>
					<li>The launch date of CDR 2.0 had to be before the 2019 spring graduation season to prepare for the massive influx of thesis papers and projects.</li>
					<li>UNC is a public institution, so we were a small team tasked with a huge backlog but had to operate on limited resources.</li>

			<h2>
				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				By the Communities, For the Communities
			</h2>

			<p>Some research had already been done before my arrival, so a major part of the work was to consolidate the findings and identify the areas that needed more work.</p>
		<div class="text">

		<div class="text">
			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes. To make sure that we understood the demographics better, I identified the various groups of users and created the following personas for both platforms.</p>
		</div>	

		<div class="text">
			<p>Lastly, going through a decade worth of web analytics archive revealed interesting navigation behavioral patterns that were previously unknown to the team.</p>
		</div>

		</div>
			<p>Key research takeaways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The existing process for searching, filtering, and viewing files in the repository was a major pain point, as the complex navigation and browsing tools only added to the confusion.</li>
				<li>Based on the link analaysis, the content consumption was not evenly distributed at all. For example: visual media saw a significantly higher use than the rest. The platform should seek to improve the experience of viewing those content.</li>
				<li>The mixing of academic and other contents was obviously problematic enough that even internal members couldn’t differentiate them from time to time.</li>

				<span>VALIDATION</span>
				A Task-Oriented Usability Test of CDR 2.0
			</h2>

			<p>As a part of my own academic research, I conducted a formal usability test with the target users. This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform — the findings were subsequently used to introduce specific workflow improvements to better prepare for the public launch.</p>

				<span>DESIGN</span>
				A New Look to the Legacy Platform
			</h2>

			<p>For the DCR legacy platform, almost all of the design efforts went into addressing age-old issues that were overlooked throughout the years of ad-hoc development.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some of the effort went into developing a concept for more intuitive and streamlined access controls for the repository administrators.</p>
