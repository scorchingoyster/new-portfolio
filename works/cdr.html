			<h2>
				<span>BACKGROUND</span>
				The Great Migration
			</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a <em>major source of growing pain when it comes to content discovery and usability</em>, and the situation only worsened as more contents were added into the repository.</p>

			<p>Thus came <strong>"The Great Migration"</strong> initiative.</p>

			<div class="graphics">
				<img src="{{ '/assets/img/cdr/split-chart.png' }}" alt="">
			</div>

			<p>The plan came in two parts:

			<p><em>Migrate the academic contents to a new open source system</em>, let it inherit the Carolina Digital Repository name (CDR 2.0), and develop new highly needed features on top of it.</p>

			<p>Rename the legacy platform to Digital Collections Repository (DCR). Without having to devise workarounds, this would <em>allow the old platform be optimized for easier maintenance</em> in the long run.</p>

			<p>This initiative had three main goals:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Untangle parts that confuse users of academic vs library contents</li>
				<li>Introduce a modern system that makes feature development more doable</li>
				<li>Improve information architecture to allow for better content organization</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Through those goals, our hope was that this would bring a significant UX and internal improvements to both platforms overall.</p>

				<span>LOGISTICS</span>
				A Two-Year Journey
			</h2>
			<p>Coming in right at the cusp of the migration kickoff planning, I filled in the much needed UX functions for the team and led all the relevant  efforts to ensure our success — whether's interviewing stakeholders, designing visual deliverables, testing with end users, or presenting to leadership.</p>
			<p>As I have front-end skills myself, I also supported the developers in some of the code and quality assurance work.</p>

				<h3>Constraints &amp; Challenges</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><em>All UX efforts had to fit within the two-year time span</em> and backup plans have to be made for the future to cover for the lack of dedicated UX function.</li>
					<li>The <em>launch date of CDR 2.0 had to be before the 2019 spring graduation season</em> to prepare for the massive influx of thesis papers and projects.</li>
					<li>UNC is a public institution, so we were <em>a small team tasked with a huge backlog</em> but had to operate on limited resources.</li>

				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				By the Communities, For the Communities

			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes. To make sure that we understood the demographics better, I consolidated my own research results with community insights and defined the following personas.</p>

			<p>Key takeaways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The existing process for <em>searching, navigating, and viewing files in the repository was a major pain point</em>.</li>
				<li>Both <em>academic contents and visual media saw a significantly higher use</em> than everything else.</li>
				<li>Mixing of contents was so problematic that even <em>staff members couldn't tell them apart at times</em>.</li>

				A Task-Oriented Usability Test of CDR 2.0
			</h2>

			<p>For my thesis research, I conducted a formal usability test with the UNC students as target users.</p>

			<p>This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform — the findings were subsequently used to introduce specific workflow improvements to better prepare for the public launch.</p>

				<span>DESIGN</span>
				A New Look to the Legacy Platform
			</h2>

			<p>For the DCR legacy platform, almost all of the design efforts went into addressing age-old issues that were overlooked throughout the years of ad-hoc development.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some of the effort went into developing a concept for more intuitive and streamlined access controls for the repository administrators.</p>
