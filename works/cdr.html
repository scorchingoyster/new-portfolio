			<h2>
				<span>BACKGROUND</span>
				The Great Migration
			</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a <em>major source of growing pain when it comes to content discovery and usability</em>, and the situation only worsened as more contents were added into the repository.</p>

			<p>Thus came <strong>"The Great Migration"</strong> initiative. The plan was to...</p>

			<div class="graphics">
				<img src="{{ '/assets/img/cdr/split-chart.png' }}" alt="">
			</div>

			<p><em>Migrate the academic contents to a new open source system</em>, let it inherit the Carolina Digital Repository name (CDR 2.0), and develop new and urgently needed features on top of it.</p>

			<p>Rename the legacy platform to Digital Collections Repository (DCR). Without having to devise workarounds, this would <em>allow the old platform be optimized for easier maintenance</em> in the long run.</p>

			<p>The main goals were to:</p>
			<ul >
				<li>Untangle parts that confuse users of academic vs library contents</li>
				<li>Introduce a modern system that makes feature development more doable</li>
				<li>Improve information architecture to allow for better content organization</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Through achieving these goals, our hope was that the migration would bring significant UX and productivity improvements to both platforms overall.</p>

				<span>LOGISTICS</span>
				A Two-Year Journey
			</h2>
			<p>Coming in right at the cusp of the migration kickoff planning, I filled in the much needed UX functions for the team and led all the relevant  efforts to ensure our success — whether's interviewing stakeholders, designing visual deliverables, testing with end users, or presenting to leadership.</p>
			<p>As I have front-end skills myself, I also supported the developers in some of the code and quality assurance work.</p>

					<li><em>All UX efforts had to fit within the two-year time span</em> and backup plans have to be made for the future to cover for the lack of dedicated UX function.</li>
					<li>The <em>launch date of CDR 2.0 had to be before the 2019 spring graduation season</em> to prepare for the massive influx of thesis papers and projects.</li>
					<li>UNC is a public institution, so we were <em>a small team tasked with a huge backlog</em> but had to operate on limited resources.</li>

				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				By the Communities, For the Communities

			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes; the team had a limited knowledge of their goals, needs, and challenges.</p>

			<p><em>To make sure that we better understand our demographics</em>, I consolidated my own research with community insights and defined these personas.</p>

			<p>Later on, I also had a chance to dig into a decade worth of web analytics. Going through the hundred thousands of unique data points <em>revealed interesting behavioral patterns that were previously unknown</em> to us.</p>

			<p>Key takeaways:</p>

				<li>The existing process for <em>searching, navigating, and viewing files in the repository was a major pain point</em>.</li>
				<li>Both <em>academic contents and visual media saw a significantly higher use</em> than everything else.</li>
				<li>Mixing of contents was so problematic that even <em>staff members couldn't tell them apart at times</em>.</li>

			<p>Aside from a dozen of ad-hoc usability tests with library stakeholders on the legacy platform — I also conducted a formal lab test with the UNC students as a part of my research thesis.</p>

			<p>This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform. The findings were subsequently used to introduce specific workflow improvements to better prepare for the public launch.</p>

			<a href="https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/masters_papers/5x21tm05m" target="_blank">The full paper can be found here</a>.

			<p>Here are some noteworthy observations from the test:</p>

			<blockquote>"It must be somewhere but I guess I just didn’t see it." The most severe instance of self-blame ... was due to the participant's perceived inability to complete the task.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>"What's the difference between keyword and subject?" Even after reading the form label instruction, most participants could not clearly explain the reasoning of having two fields that serve a similar purpose.</blockquote>

				<span>DESIGN</span>
				A New Look to the Legacy Platform
			</h2>

			<p>For the DCR legacy platform, almost all of the design efforts went into addressing age-old issues that were overlooked throughout the years of ad-hoc development.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some of the effort went into developing a concept for more intuitive and streamlined access controls for the repository administrators.</p>
