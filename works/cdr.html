				<span>BACKGROUND</span>
				The Great Migration
			</h2>

			<p>Up until 2019, both the academic contents and the libraries' historical archives lived in a monolithic repository system &mdash; this was a major source of growing pains when it comes to content discovery and usability, and the situation only worsened as more contents were added into the repository.</p>

			<p>Thus came <strong>"The Great Migration"</strong> initiative.</p>

			<p>At the highest level, the inititiave aimed to address the following problems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tangled use cases that confuse users of academic vs archival contents</li>
				<li>Limited legacy software system that make adding new features challenging</li>
				<li>Dense information architecture that leads to disorganization of contents</li>
			</ul>
		<div class="text">

		<div class="text">

			<p>The answer was to migrate the academic contents to a new open source repository system and have it inherit the name of Carolina Digital Repository (CDR 2.0).</p>

			<p>Without having to devise workarounds, the renamed legacy system &mdash; Digital Collections Repository (DCR) &mdash; can be optimized and more easily maintained in the long run.</p>

				<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

					<li><b>Core Team</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Three fullstack developers &ndash; share development work across both platforms</li>
							<li>Two program managers &ndash; manages each platform respectively</li>
							<li>A metadata specialist &ndash; supports content organization and migration</li>
							<li>Myself</li>

					<li><b>Library Stakeholders</b>

							<li>Head of UX &ndash; provide UX guidance and feedback</li>
							<li>Various department heads as primary stakeholders</li>

				<h3>Constraints &amp; Challenges</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>All UX efforts had to fit within the two-year time span and backup plans have to be made for the future to cover for the lack of dedicated UX support</li>
					<li>Launch date of CDR 2.0 had to be before the 2019 spring graduation season to prepare for the massive influx of thesis papers and projects</li>
					<li>UNC is a public institution, so we were a small team tasked with a huge backlog but had to operate on limited resources</li>

				<span>RESEARCH</span>
				By the Communities, For the Communities
			</h2>

			<p>Some research had already been done before my arrival, so a major part of the work was to consolidate the findings and identify the areas that needed more work.</p>
		<div class="text">

		<div class="text">
			<p>Before the split, it was harder to pinpoint which group of users were using the platform for what purposes. To make sure that we understood the demographics better, I identified the various groups of users and created the following personas for both platforms.</p>
		</div>	

		<div class="text">
			<p>Lastly, going through a decade worth of web analytics archive revealed interesting navigation behavioral patterns that were previously unknown to the team.</p>
		</div>

		</div>
			<p>Key research takeaways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The existing process for searching, filtering, and viewing files in the repository was a major pain point, as the complex navigation and browsing tools only added to the confusion.</li>
				<li>Based on the link analaysis, the content consumption was not evenly distributed at all. For example: visual media saw a significantly higher use than the rest. The platform should seek to improve the experience of viewing those content.</li>
				<li>The mixing of academic and other contents was obviously problematic enough that even internal members couldn’t differentiate them from time to time.</li>

				<span>VALIDATION</span>
				A Task-Oriented Usability Test of CDR 2.0
			</h2>

			<p>As a part of my own academic research, I conducted a formal usability test with the target users. This was done with the alpha release of the new CDR 2.0 platform — the findings were subsequently used to introduce specific workflow improvements to better prepare for the public launch.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>DESIGN</span>
				A New Look to the Legacy Platform
			</h2>

			<p>For the DCR legacy platform, almost all of the design efforts went into addressing age-old issues that were overlooked throughout the years of ad-hoc development.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some of the effort went into developing a concept for more intuitive and streamlined access controls for the repository administrators.</p>
