<h1>Evalueserve: The mind+machine&trade; Method</h1>

<p>Currently, I serve as a UX specialist for the data analytics consulting firm. Since joining, I have lead the UX consultation and design efforts of over a dozen client projects across different domains.</p>

<p>(Due to the strict compliance nature of the firm, limited amount of information is shared here. See ISO 27001 standard.)</p>

<p>Our clients are business leaders and domain experts who have no exposure to design thinking, who are in the process of developing a new product or adopting a digital transformation &mdash; it is my job to guide them through this process and partner with them to create the best experience for their customers or the members of their organization.</p>


<h2>
	Selected Project 
	<strong>Customer Segmentation Platform Prototype</strong>
</h2>

<p>In order to thrive in a competitive market, companies need a reliable and efficient process to digest their customer data and gain effective insights at different dimensions.</p>

<p>This is where the Customer Segmentation Platform comes into the picture.</p>

<p>With the use of machine learning algorithms &mdash; the system will cluster the provided customer data into different segments, each of which exhibit unique behaviors, and the analysis results can be further understood with the use of the dynamic visualization tools.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this data-driven approach is to help the marketing team make more informed decisions on how to win new customers and retain existing ones.</p>


<h2><strong>Getting to Work</strong></h2>

<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Data Analytics Team
		<ul>
			<li>AVP, marketing domain expert</li>
			<li>Manager, provide business requirements</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		UX Team
		<ul>
			<li>Group Manager, peer reviewer and provide strategic guidance</li>
			<li>UX Engineer (me), lead all UX efforts</li>
			<li>UI Developer, provide tech consultation</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints &amp; Challenges</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Limited end user access: this is a product prototype slated for future development, so we couldn’t ask clients to help with user research</li>
	<li>Unclear constraints: less than half of the 1.0 product roadmap was available at first</li>
	<li>Work adjustments: the project kicked off in the first month of the 2020 pandemic when there’s a sudden switch to full remote work</li>
</ul>


<h2>
	Timeline
	<strong>A Four-Month Experimentation</strong>
</h2>


<h2><strong>The Evalueserve UX Process</strong></h2>

<p>The UX team follow a modified lean UX process flexibly fitted to support the firm’s operations. This process is put into use for a wide variety of research & design requests that come to us.</p>


<h2>
	Research
	<strong>For Everyone in the Marketing Team</strong>
</h2>

<p>Due to the constraints &amp; challenges as stated earlier, the methods used can best be described as skunkworks UX research &mdash; simpler and ad hoc methods to gain as much insight in a shorter time. This was to ensure the effort will fit within the project timeframe.</p>

<p>The product was intended to be used by different members of a marketing team, and aimed to fulfill both business-to-business and retail marketing needs. These proto-personas were used to guide the design discussions and elucidate potential features.</p>

<p>(Original information of the personas not provided for confidentiality reasons.)</p>

<p>Key research takeaways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are alternatives in the market that solve the same pain points for users, the difference is in the sophistication of the data-driven approaches &mdash; it’s a depth vs breadth problem.</li>
	<li>Existing tools offer a wealth of data, but they often lack concrete and actionable suggestions for marketing operations.</li>
	<li>There is a balance for these tools to be doing too much vs too little for the users, where the former is restrictive at times and the latter doesn’t offer enough business value for its cost.</li>
</ul>


<h2>
	Design
	<strong>Collaboration with Rapid Iterations</strong>
</h2>

<p>Working closely with the business stakeholder for several weeks, we progressively translated the research results, collective understanding, and requirements into visual artifcats.</p>

<p>As this product is slated for future development, this marks the end of my involvement at the time of the writing.</p>


<h2>
	<strong>Suggested Next Steps</strong>
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Create clickable prototypes and test real tasks with target users to assess and validate the overall usability of the design to avoid rework down the road.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the UX team is involved during development to assist in evaluating whether the business and requirements are properly translated.</li>
	<li>After the product launch, devise follow-up feedback mechanisms and processes to ensure the users’ voices are heard &mdash; this allows for further improvement of the platform in the future.</li>
</ul>
