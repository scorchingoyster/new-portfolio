			<h1>The mind+machine&trade; Method</h1>

			<p>Currently, I am serving as a UX Engineer for the data analytics consulting firm, <a href="http://evalueserve.com/" target="_blank">Evalueserve</a> &mdash; "engineer" is used here in the sense of a technical specialist, not akin to a software engineer.</p>

			<p>(Due to the strict confidentiality nature of the firm, very limited amount of information is shared below. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001" target="_blank">ISO 27001 standard</a>.)</p>

			<p>Our clients and stakeholders are business leaders and domain experts who tend to have little to no exposure to UX and product design, and are in need of urgent guidance in such areas. I'm here to partner with them to create the best experience tailored to their users.</p>

				The Universal Pain Point
			</h2>

			<p>Having worked with many different clients in business domains such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Financial risk management</li>
				<li>Economic and social development</li>
				<li>Market &amp; customer analytics</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The one common thing is that they all come with a solution already in mind. Yet, when I start asking about their users, they always respond saying...</p>

			<blockquote>You know, that's a really good question.</blockquote>

			<p>It tells me that <em>they are skipping too far ahead without understanding their users' problems well enough</em> &mdash; this is where I come into the picture.</p>

				A Right Approach for the Consulting Practice
			</h2>

			<p>Unlike product organizations, consulting firms operate on a flexible pace due to their contractual cycles with different clients &mdash; everyone comes to us with a similar need, but with a variety of demographics and challenges.</p>

			<p>When it comes to UX work, it means that our team has to <em>favor methods that are more fitting for this particular environment</em> in order to stay nimble and lead the UX effort more efficiently and adaptively for our stakeholders, clients... and most importantly, their users.</p>

				<li>Rather than starting from a blank slate every time, I <em>work our domain experts regularly to understand the problems</em> from their point of view.</li>
				<li>Most custom products we build are for <em>solving a different set of problems in similar ways</em>, so I conduct competitive analysis of existing products on the market whenever appropriate.</li>
				<li>As our clients' business domain are longstanding industries, there are <em>plenty of literature available to reinforce my understanding</em>. I often refer to academic and industry research throughout each project.</li>
				<li>Similarly, whenever I'm unable to gain access to end users for research needs, there are <em>general industry knowledge out in the open</em> that would at least fill in for the creation of proto-personas.</li>
