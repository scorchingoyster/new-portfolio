			<h1>Designing for an Audience in Security</h1>

			<p>For a while, I served as the sole designer for the application security startup. nVisium. I led all the design efforts for the company &mdash; ranging from web front-end development, branding, to media editing and production.</p>

			<p>This was my first role out of college. As a young professional, I couldn't have learned enough to keep up with the challenge in such a short time, had it not because of the inspiration and support from my colleagues back then.</p>

			<p>(And this is where I discovered my interest in information security.)</p>

				Iterating on the Main Website
			</h2>
			<p>Working with our Director of Engineering, I designed and developed the front-end portion of the company's website, moving it from the generic Bootstrap 3 template and into my custom layouts. This spanned across two major iterations and many more minor feature improvements over time.</p>

				<li>Rather than starting from a blank slate every time, I <em>work our domain experts regularly to understand the problems</em> from their point of view.</li>
				<li>Most custom products we build are for <em>solving a different set of problems in similar ways</em>, so I conduct competitive analysis of existing products on the market whenever appropriate.</li>
				<li>As our clients' business domain are longstanding industries, there are <em>plenty of literature available to reinforce my understanding</em>. I often refer to academic and industry research throughout each project.</li>
				<li>Similarly, whenever I'm unable to gain access to end users for research needs, there are <em>general industry knowledge out in the open</em> that would at least fill in for the creation of proto-personas.</li>
