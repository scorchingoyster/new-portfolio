	<p>Some fun facts about me and this site:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Yes, that's the Washington Monument in the picture. (I really love that scene in Forrest Gump.)</li>
		<li>The site logo is based on <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8F" target="_blank">the middle character</a> of my name.</li>
		<li>I handbuilt this website using plain HTML5 and generated the pages via Jekyll. You can see the source on my GitHub repo. (This site is gonna stay as a work-in-progress project.)</li>
		<li>I "know" a few languages. In sequence of proficiency: English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Tagalog. I would probaby become a casual linguist if I never had to work for a living.</li>
		<li>Part of the reason why I know some of those languages is because I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third culture kid</a>. I have also been living in a different continent from the rest of my family since I was 16.</li>
		<li>In an alternate timeline, I'm probably a privacy advocate and a security researcher. I'm merely a hobbyist in this one.</li>
		<li>This site doesn't have any cookie or tracking script! Rejoice!</li>
